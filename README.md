# flux

**SCM made by me for small projects.**

## Philosophy

The idea is to have a simple SCM that can be used for small projects. It is not meant to be used for large projects, but it can be used for them. It is meant to be used for small projects that don't need a lot of features.

## Features

- [ ] Add files
- [ ] Remove files
- [ ] Commit files
- [ ] Branches
- [ ] Merge branches
- [ ] View commit history
- [ ] Resolve merge conflicts
- [ ] Collaborate with others
- [ ] Push to remote
- [ ] Pull from remote
- [ ] Clone remote


### Remote repository hosting

Soon, I will create a remote repository hosting service for flux. It will be free and open source, and you will have to self host.

- [ ] HTTP
- [ ] SSH
